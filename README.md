## Project description

This report is carried out to ascertain opportunities to increase revenue and track the performance of courses at Udemy. The report also aims to confirm if “Web Development” courses are the most popular and if increasing the prices of the “Web Development” courses will lead to a proportional increase in revenue.

## Problem Statement

The problem faced by Udemy is figuring out opportunities to increase subsequent quarterly earnings. A time frame of about three weeks was assigned for this project. The following data are required for a better understanding of the problem; Current year and previous year earnings, Courses offered and their subjects, Prices of each course, Users' review/feedback, and Duration of the courses.
To better understand the business problem, the following questions were asked?
- What are the business's earnings per subject?
- What is the number of courses offered during this period and how many were taken (free/paid for)?
- Which courses/topics bring in the highest revenue and cost?
- What is the duration of the course(s)?
- What is the review from users that take the course(s)? Which subjects have the highest number of enrollments? 
- Which subjects bring in the lowest revenue and cost?
- Which subjects have the lowest number of enrollments?

## Data Design

In order to work with a clean set of data:

1.) Duplicate and blank cells were filtered out.

2.) Headers were edited to ensure ease of analysis. 

3.) Cells containing data inconsistent with other cells on a
column were adjusted. In this case, “subject: Web Development” was changed to “Web Development”.

Pivot tables on Google Sheets alongside Tableau were utilized to determine and visualize factors and trends regarding each subject at each level respectively.

## Findings

- Total Subscriptions by Subject

    "Web Development" courses have the highest number of subscribers, 
    followed by "Business Finance", "Graphic Design", and "Musical Instrument" courses respectively.

- Average Price by Skill Level

    On average, the price of "Web Development" courses is the highest at the "Intermediate Level", 
    "Expert Level", "Beginner Level", and "All Levels". While "Graphic Design" courses have the least price on average at the "Expert Level", 
    and "Musical Instrument" courses have the least price on average at the "Beginner Level" 
    and "All Levels".

- Earning per Year by Skill Level

## Analysis

From the findings above, we can determine “Web Development” courses to be the most popular courses then followed by “Business Finance”, “Graphic Design”, and Musical Instrument” courses respectively (figure 1). After a 70% fall (the highest of the four courses) in its number of subscribers, it still retains its position as the most popular. The fall in the number of subscribers of each course has caused a decline in Udemy’s revenue.

Furthermore, the cause of the revenue problem is due to the business losing subscribers in 2016 unlike its continuous increase in subscribers from 2011 to 2015(figure 3). This led to the plummeting of revenue in 2016 and 2017. The possible reason for this sudden drop in subscribers might be due to the content of the courses not being satisfactory or insightful enough.

Also, the decline in the number of subscribers might result from customers shifting their interest to an alternative competing company providing more quality content for the courses.

## Conclusion

The report shows that charging more for the ”Web Development” courses will help increase Udemy's subsequent revenue, as the “Web Development” courses still have the highest number of subscribers regardless of the fall compared to the previous year. Additional growth in the number of subscribers and revenue can be expected if action is taken to ensure the delivery of more quality course content.
