# New York City Airbnb Project

### Report Link: [Data Analysis Portfolio.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16060150/Data.Analysis.Portfolio.pdf)

## Project description

This report is carried out to determine the borough and room type that has the highest earning potential for individuals with available spaces for Airbnb in New York City. The report also aims to confirm which borough, and room type, will have the most reservation.

## Data Design
To work with a clean set of data: 

1.) Blank cells were filtered out.

2.) Headers were bolded to ensure ease of analysis.

3.) The column header titled “neighbourhood_group” was
modified to “borough” to give a more descriptive header.

Pivot tables on Google Sheets alongside Tableau were utilized to determine and visualize factors and trends regarding each room type in each city respectively.

## Findings

- Average Price by Room Type

    The average price of reserving an "Entire Home/Apartment" is the highest across Boroughs, 
    followed by "Private room", then "Shared room".

    On average, "Private rooms" in Staten Island are the most available for reservation in a year. 
    The next most available spaces are "Shared rooms" in Queens. 
    While the least available spaces are "Shared rooms" in Staten Island.

- Average Price per Room Type by Borough

## Analysis

From the visualizations above, we can determine that users who require enough room, most users with a family, will potentially make a reservation for an “entire room/apartment“ in “Manhattan” as this has the highest listing count(figure 3), whilst users who prefer their personal space will most likely make a reservation for a “private room” and following the listing count, “private rooms” will most likely be reserved in “Queens”(figure 3). Then users who are working with a low budget will make a reservation for “shared rooms” and following the listing count, “shared rooms” are most likely to be reserved in “Brooklyn” and “Staten Island” respectively.

However, it can be assumed that spaces(room types) in Manhattan will have the most reservations. The reason is that spaces in Manhattan have the highest average price(figure 3) compared to other boroughs and visitors are likely to attach a perception of higher comfort or luxury to the spaces due to the pricing. Also, the listing count for spaces(room types) in Manhattan is quite competitive on average as they have the highest listing count for “entire home/apartment'', second for “private rooms” and third for “shared rooms”.

## Conclusion

The report shows that individuals with an entire home/apartment in Manhattan available for Airbnb will most likely earn more than those with an entire home/apartment in Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Staten Island. Individuals with “private rooms” available in Queens will most likely earn more than others, while individuals with “shared rooms” available in Brooklyn and/or Staten Island will most likely earn more than those in other boroughs. This is a result of the demographic of their visitors which are; a wealthy and accompanied visitor will presumably reserve an entire home/apartment in Manhattan, a middle-class lone visitor will presumably reserve a private room in Queens, while a visitor with a low budget will presumably settle for a shared room in Brooklyn or Staten Island.
